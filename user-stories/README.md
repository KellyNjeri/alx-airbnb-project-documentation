# User Stories

This directory contains the **user stories** for the project, outlining how various types of users will interact with the system. Each user story provides a clear description of the user's goals, the actions they will take, and the expected outcomes.  

## Purpose
User stories serve as the foundation for:
- Capturing **functional requirements** from a user perspective.  
- Guiding the **design and development** of features.  
- Ensuring the system delivers **real value to end-users**.  

## Structure
Each user story typically includes:
- **Title:** A brief description of the story.  
- **As a [type of user]:** Who the story is for.  
- **I want to [action]:** What the user wants to achieve.  
- **So that [benefit]:** The outcome or reason behind the action.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Conditions that define when the story is considered complete.

## Usage
- Each user story will be stored as an individual markdown file (e.g., `user-story-1.md`).
- Stories may be categorized by user type (e.g., admin, customer, driver).
- Updates should reflect changes in user requirements during project development.

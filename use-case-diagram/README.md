# Use Case Diagram

This directory contains the use case diagram(s) that illustrate the interactions between users (actors) and the system. It provides a high-level functional view of the system before detailed design and development.

## Overview
Use case diagrams help define:
- Who will use the system (actors)
- What actions they can perform (use cases)
- How the system responds to those actions

## Contents
- **Use Case Diagram:** A visual representation (e.g., UML diagram)
- **Actor Descriptions:** Brief roles and responsibilities of each actor
- **Use Case Narratives:** Short descriptions for each use case explaining its purpose and flow

## Purpose
The use case diagram is used as a communication tool between business analysts, developers, and stakeholders to ensure the system's functionality aligns with user requirements.
